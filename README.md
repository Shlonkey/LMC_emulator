#LMC EMULATOR, ASSEMBLER & COMPILER
This repo contains 3 peices of software;
    1) Emulator for the fictional 'Little Man Computer' (LMC) microprocessor
    2) Assembler for taking a file containing LMC instructions, and converting it into a binary file which can be loaded into the emulator
    3) (WIP) Compiler for compiling my own custom programming language (Basically a subset of C syntax with VERY limited instructions).
